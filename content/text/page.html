      My work is a call for change, a gentle yet unyielding demand for a new way
      of being. We are living through a time of profound disconnection, where
      digital illusions and performative identities often take the place of
      genuine connection and truth. In this world of fragmentation and
      make-believe, our daughters are growing up surrounded by false mirrors.
      They are being shaped by forces that too often diminish their sense of
      worth. It is time for a new revolution, one that is quietly powerful. A
      revolution of remembering, of returning to what is real, embodied, and
      whole. My art is part of this revolution. Through painting, I reclaim a
      space of deep seeing, one that rejects distortion and affirms the
      spiritual and ancestral richness of the feminine experience. As mothers,
      we have an essential role in this transformation. We are not only
      caretakers of our daughters, but guardians of the world they will inherit.
      We must begin to dismantle the barriers, internal and external, that have
      kept us silent all this time.

    <p>
      Becoming a mother is not a dead end for an artist, in fact, in my case, it
      has been the absolute source of my artistry. Motherhood is clearly a
      multidimensional experience with as many varied perspectives as there are
      mothers on the planet. Personally, motherhood has been a driving force,
      pushing towards the creative craft of painting, allowing me space to
      unpack this theme. Motherhood is about exploring selflessness,
      empowerment, vulnerability, empathy, failure, choice, it is a source of
      liberation and power… and it sure doesn’t end when your children are
      grown-up, it changes, and changes you.

      I call my art collection “Edenfield”. Edenfield refers to a suburb in my
      hometown, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, it’s where I grew up... a four hectares
      utopia full of bougainvillea blossoms, birds of paradise flowers, peach
      trees, banana trees, avocado trees, passion fruit vines and so much more.
      My art is my Eden, it blossoms with fields of colour and creation. It is a
      formation by my own hand to gift to my daughters and their daughters to
      come, my legacy. My “Fields of Eden” or “Edenfield”, is unlike the story
      from the bible that still echoes in our cultures, it is not a place of
      female expulsion, my story celebrates women as a constant in Edenfield. A
      paradise that will remain at its zenith in the future and beyond.

    <p>Bio</p>
    <p>
      I am an artist born and raised in Zimbabwe, now living in Southern Sweden.
      As a painter but foremost a mother, I dive into a discovery of selfhood,
      motherhood, daughterhood and matrescence through my large acrylic works. I
      aim to enrich a dialogue of a new female revolution that anchors itself in
      our understanding of the spiritual DNA and experiences which bonds
      grandmothers, mothers and daughters in the pathway of life; past, future
      and present.
    </p>
    <p>My approach</p>
    <p>
      My paintings are a sacred act, one of both resistance and restoration.
      They are a response to the subtle, yet great harm that I witness social
      media inflicting on the inner lives of my daughters. In a world mediated
      by curated images and momentary digital impressions, I turn to painting a
      s a means of slowing down time, re-centering presence and reclaiming the
      untold stories of our daughters. Through my art I construct symbolic
      “filters”, not the digital kind, but spiritual veils that both reveal and
      protect. These “filters” offer a deeper seeing, a layered truth shaped by
      love, ancestral memory, intuition an the unseen forces that guide us. My
      work is a call for change, a gentle yet unyielding demand for a new way of
      being. In this world of fragmentation, our daughters are growing up
      surrounded by false mirrors. It is now a time for truth-telling and
      reclamation of the feminine through love.

    <p>Figuarative Art</p>
    <p>
      My daughters are my primary source of inspiration. I am fascinated by the
      form, movement and the change of the female body. Movement and dance have
      always been fundamental in my life. As my father was an ethnomusicologist,
      much of my childhood was spent in the bush listening to the sounds of
      marimbas, mbiras, drums and song echoing into the expansive African night.
      The dust from the red soil slowly rising from the stomping of rhythmic
      feet felt so natural and normal to me but had you seen me in this
      childhood picture, you would have found it strange. A child born and grown
      up in a society that fully embraced and accepted her despite her visible
      difference was transcendent. I have always felt like an outsider and
      insider at the same time. I live in a constant state of foreign-ship and
      home is nowhere and everywhere at the same time. So, the African in me
      continued to flourish in Sweden, I found myself dancing as a child and
      dancing as a mother, and that spiritual DNA flourished and was passed on
      to my daughters, dance is simply part of our lives. As my daughters grew,
      I watched how they moved, how they held themselves, and their gift of
      being so aware of their bodies has inspired my art. I also witnessed my
      daughters’ struggle to fit in to their context, to fit into a society that
      was/is quite the opposite to how they were raised. They, like me, lived
      (and are living) a juxtaposed existence where the norms of their current
      society did not merge with those taught at home, thus creating a sense of
      cultural dissonance and loneliness. The confusion my daughters faced of
      seemingly looking like their peers, but not recognizing themselves in
      their peers, was difficult at times. Not until they grew older did my
      daughters speak out their appreciation of their difference in culture,
      thoughts, and actions. Today they carry their inner difference with pride.

    <p>Dualistic Art</p>
    <p>
      Living in the in-between, a dualistic existence, gave birth to one of my
      painting concepts. In some of my works, I juxtapose my models with an
      image created by myself; a real image with an imagined one, so that two
      fields become one. Words from poems and images from original paintings
      have been projected and painted onto the bodies of my daughters, like
      tattoos that seep into their beings attempting to speak a new story. My
      artistry is a way to empower my daughters. Each painting shines a light on
      the stories shared between, with and for daughters and mothers. These
      stories can be transferred to a larger global context inviting others to
      think about the stories that our young girls carry with them in our
      societies today.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, I am not only a painter, but also a storyteller. Each painting is
      paired with a written narrative, a story that reveals something intimate
      and essential about my daughters: who they are, who they are becoming, and
      the quiet magic they hold within. These stories are modern day fairytales,
      that talk about those very personal issues that our young women are forced
      to face every day. They tell of a young womans search for courage, for
      voice, for beauty and imagination and I am sure that they echo the
      universal longing for all our daughters to be truly seen and understood.
      As a mother-artist, I feel an urgent responsiblity to preserve and pass on
      the knowledge of storytelling. In a world increasingly driven by noise and
      distraction, storytelling, especially through art, becomes a form of
      resistance, a grounding thread that connects past, present and future. My
      paintings of my daughters are not just visual objects; they are
      repositories of growth, of memory, identity and hope. They are a way of
      saying: “We were here, we lived, we loved and this is what it meant.”

    <p>Perimenopausal Art</p>
    <p>
      Selfhood is explored within my art, this is illustrated through the large
      acrylic paintings of figurative women, using myself as a model. As my body
      goes through the changes that come with aging, I have had to re-create who
      I am now as a women and as a mother. “Lilith” is a reflection of this
      god-awful perimenopausal epoch and is a self-portrait of me at this time.
      The story of Lilith comes from old Christian scriptures, she was Adam’s
      first wife. It is said that Lilith was made from the same soil as Adam,
      thus making them equal. When Lilith asserted her equality and refused to
      lie under Adam, she was banished from Eden for this disobedience. Lilith
      fled to the Red Sea wher she turned into a temptress, a breeder of demon
      spirites and killer of children in the night. (I can relate.) My body has
      decided, without my consent, to murder my ability to bear children and has
      killed my sense of womanhood to some extent, and much like Lilith, I feel
      the damnation. At the same time I recognize this damnation as a blessing,
      a rite of passage into the second act of my life. This is a journey of
      self-expression, celebrating the multifaceted layers of my identity, and
      embracing the beauty of growing older. I challenge my own ideas of beauty
      and aging, reclaiming agency over my image and my own being, reinventing
      myself in this process. My self-portraits recognize the complexity of a
      life lived, reflecting the experiences that shape who I am at this pivotal
      stage in my perimenopausal life. By baring myself both physically and
      emotionally, I allow you to witness the unapologetic celebration of my
      body at this time, free from constraints and expectations. These vibrant
      nudes serve as a declaration of self-acceptance and empowerment, going
      beyond ageist notions and affirming the vitality and vibrancy of life
      beyond youth.

    <p>My art invites “Slow looking”...</p>
    <p>
      My art invites “slow looking”. According a study done by the Tate Gallery
      in the UK, visitors only spend around 8 seconds looking at each painting
      in a gallery, which is why the initiative of “slow looking” is a focus
      point in my art exhibition. Within my frames I have included a source of
      light, revealing what I call, the spirit of the painting. This ethereal
      realm of light asks you, the audience to sit for a while, to gaze, to
      stare, to pause, to de-stress and embrace the present moment as you watch
      how light interacts with the painted colours on the canvas changing the
      original image, from one to many.
    </p>
    <p>
      My paintings are to be viewed as the sun starts to set, outdoors in a park
      or a garden, as the peaceful evening curtains the sky. Using the outdoors,
      a garden or park as my gallery space seems a fitting place to exhibit my
      Edenfield collection. As you sit, sipping your wine, in my outdoor gallery
      at night, allow the interplay of colour and light to illuminate your
      perceptions, connecting art to the natural world around you.

      aims to foster a dialogue of a new female revolution that anchors itself
      in our understanding of our spiritual DNA and experiences. Experiences
      that bond grandmothers, mothers and daughters in the pathway of life;
      past, future and present

    <p>Abstract</p>
    <p>
      This poem is a reflection on the contradictions inherent to futures work.
      Pasts, presents and futures fold in on each other and this is reflected in
      the deliberately tribal image offered by Kristoffersson. In both image and
      poem lies biography and memory both personal and also epochal. Time is
      sticky and we must deal with that as best we can.
