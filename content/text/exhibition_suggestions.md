# Exhibition Content Suggestions

- Working title: Evening Garden Exhibition 2025
- Tagline candidate: My work is a quiet revolution...
- Theme anchor: Edenfield — a paradise of feminine lineage, memory, and becoming.

## Overview (short blurb)
My work is a call for change — a quiet yet unyielding revolution of remembering, returning to what is embodied and whole. In a world of fragmentation and digital illusion, these paintings reclaim a deeper seeing shaped by love, intuition, and ancestral memory. Edenfield is my living garden: a field of color and creation that honors the spiritual DNA connecting grandmothers, mothers, and daughters across time.

## Exhibition Statement (longer)
We are living through profound disconnection, where curated identities too often replace genuine presence. Our daughters are growing up amidst false mirrors. This exhibition responds with slowness and care — paintings as resistance and restoration. I construct symbolic “filters,” not digital, but spiritual: veils that both reveal and protect. Edenfield (Fields of Eden) is a counter‑narrative to expulsion myths: a place where women remain constant in a thriving paradise. The works trace selfhood, motherhood, daughterhood, and matrescence, speaking to the quiet magic of becoming and the wisdom of lineage.

## Sections and Capsules
