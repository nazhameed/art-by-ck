  <h2 class="mt-4">Artist Bio.</h2>
  <p>I am an artist born and raised in Zimbabwe, now living in Southern Sweden.<br>
  As a painter but foremost as a mother, I explore the layered experiences of selfhood, motherhood, daughterhood, and matrescence through my large-scale acrylic works.</p>
  <p>My art seeks to enrich the dialogue of a new female revolution, one that anchors itself in the spiritual DNA connecting grandmothers, mothers, and daughters across time — past, present, and future.<br>
  Through my paintings, I trace the invisible threads that bind us, exploring womanhood as both memory and prophecy.</p>

  <h2 class="mt-5">My Approach</h2>
  <p>My paintings are a sacred act - one of both resistance and restoration.<br>
  They arise from my response to the subtle, yet profound harm I witness in how social media shapes the inner lives of our daughters.</p>
  <p>In a world defined by curated images and fleeting digital impressions, I turn to painting as a way to slow down time, recenter presence, and reclaim untold stories.</p>
  <p>Through my art, I construct symbolic filters, not the digital kind, but spiritual veils that both reveal and protect.<br>
  These filters offer a deeper seeing: a layered truth shaped by love, ancestral memory, intuition, and the unseen forces that guide us.</p>
  <p>My work is a call for change — a gentle yet unyielding demand for a new way of being.<br>
  In this fragmented world, our daughters grow up surrounded by false mirrors.<br>
  It is time for truth-telling, for the reclamation of the feminine through love.</p>
